1.	How do I approach designing software?
  o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    I have developed new design skills for structuring an OpenGL 3D model. It has allowed me to see how models interact with each other and how to handle lighting effects and what it can do to the final product. 
  o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
    The process involves a lot of altering and checking. I need to look at my work from multiple angles and judge how accurate the 3D models were. This being my first class in 3D modeling I don’t think it was a bad replication of the original. 
  o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    I know when I design things like this in the future I will need to pay extra attention to how the textures interact with each other and how much the lighting plays on the final image. Also it can take a while tweaking the shapes to get them to replicate more        accurately what you are looking for. Because we are rendering it in a 3D model, with textures and lighting, it can sometimes appear a little bit different than the original image, but it is usually done for a reason. 
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
  o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Strategies I developed were a lot of checking and re-checking work. It really pushed the importance of testing to ensure you get the final product you are looking for.
  o	How did iteration factor into your development?
    Iteration is a necessary process to ensure that the placement and scale are correct. They are usually never correct the first time and from different angles can appear wrong and need correcting. An example, my cup initially appeared upside down and needed         adjustments. The bread piece initially were small and blocks and needed re-shaping to more closely resemble the bread shape I was looking for. 
  o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
    One thing I noticed in my approach is time. It’s not a simple code to fix something and there is always room for improvement. There needs to come a point especially with 3D models that you have to say it looks close enough. Needing perfection is something that     is hard to achieve. When coding an application it is easy to see if it works perfectly how you want it and there is a clear completion. With modeling, I find that I needed to try and just get it as close as I could and understand that something might need to be     adapted from the original.
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
   I know that in this modeling class, I needed to imagine a grid. Everything is calculated down to the last detail and many layers of attention to render even a small simple image. It can take a while to get something that you are looking for.
  o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    Computational graphics and visualizations provide a technical skill and problem solving skills which will help translate into the real world. Transformation, robotics, game development and even CAD drafting all use similar skills and can help with the necessary     work. Projects require time effort and finding a level of acceptance with modeling because there isn’t a real “complete” in this world.
